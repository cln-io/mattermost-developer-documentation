This page compiles all Cypress custom commands based on specific sections of the web app, as well as other general examples. The examples provided showcase the best and conventions on how to write great automated test scripts.
We encourage everyone to read this information, ask questions if something is not clear, and challenge the mentioned practices so that we can continuously refine and improve.

If you need to add more custom commands, add them to `/e2e/cypress/tests/support`, and check out the {{<newtabref href="https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands.html" title="Cypress custom commands">}} documentation. For ease of use, in-code documentation functionality, and making custom commands more discoverable, add type definitions. See this example: {{<newtabref href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/blob/master/e2e/cypress/tests/support/api/user.d.ts" title="declaration file" >}} for reference on how to include.
